Today is officially the first day of the Christmas holidays for me. I set my alarm last night for 5:30am and I managed to get up this morning, so I grabbed my camera and headed down for the sunrise. It's nice and warm this morning at 24 degrees  apparently going to rain later this afternoon.
And for all the nerds out there that might be interested, as of last night I have converted this site over to a [Jekyll blog](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means fast free hosting with version control.
Feel free to check out my [git repo](https://github.com/livemanlybeach) for this site and raise a pull request ; )

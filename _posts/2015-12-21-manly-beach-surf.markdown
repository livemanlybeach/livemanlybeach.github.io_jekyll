After succesfully getting up for the sunrise this morning I thought I tried something different this
afternoon and get in the water to take some video. It was hard swimming around and trying to stay out of peoples way, next time I will take some flippers with me.
I had fun and got some ok video, some shots I was pointing the wrong way and I was diving under the wave early so I missed people going past, I'll have to remember to work on that next time, but it's a good first effort.

I was standing out on our balcony and noticed lightning on the horizon so I grabbed my camera and tripod and headed to the roof.
It wasn't raining which was good and I must have taken about 50 long exposure shots trying to capture the lightning.
Most of the photos came out rubbish but I managed to get a few good ones.

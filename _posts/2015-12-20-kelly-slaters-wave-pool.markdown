Kelly Slater has released a video of an artificial wave park that he says he has been secretly working on with a team of engineers for the last 10 years.

Although the location was supposed to be a secret within hours of the video being released people were speculating that the wave pool is [located in Central Valley California](http://www.swellnet.com/news/swellnet-dispatch/2015/12/19/blowing-location-slaters-wave-pool)

No information has been released yet on how Slaters wave pool generates waves but its probably a similar design to [Snowdonia](https://www.surfsnowdonia.co.uk/wavegarden/) located in North Wales which pulls a shovel shaped object along an under water track, the difference in these two parks I imagine would be the shape of bottom of the lagoon.

The wavefoil used is a large hydrodynamic blade that shares similarities with an aeroplane wing and the plow of a snowcat. Moving along an underwater track driven by a large flywheel, the wavefoil shuttles underwater from one end of the lagoon to the other to create a clean swell. The energy of the swell interacts with the shallowing sections of the lagoons bed, causing it to build in size and steepen. Directly induced by the bathymetry, the swell turns into a wave and starts to break along a sculpted embankment.

[Bathymetry](http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/marine/bathymetry) is the study and mapping of seafloor topography. It involves obtaining measurements of the depth of the ocean and is equivalent to mapping the topography on land.

I can't wait for these wave parks to hit Australia and it looks like the first wave pool in Australia will be built in the Gold Coast with Kelly Slater and LM Investments announcing that they have [signed a deal to build a surf park at the new Maddison Estate development](http://www.surfparkcentral.com/kelly-slater-wave-company-and-lm-investments-sign-wave-pool-deal/).

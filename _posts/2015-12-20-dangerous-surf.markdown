A collection of some youtube videos of extremely dangerous surf.

##Huge Shorebreaks in Hawaii

This first video appears to be in Hawaii and shows some tourists getting slammed by huge shorebreaks, the ignorant onlookers laugh and don't seem to understand the danger these guys are in. After the second wave breaks I think they quickly regret their decsision to go into the water.

##The Wedge Newport California

This next video is of people surfing at The Wedge which is a spot located at the east end of the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach, California which is known for its large wedge shaped waves that makes it a popular spot for skimboarding, surfing, bodyboarding and bodysurfing. During a south or south/southwest swell of the right size and aligned in the swell window, the Wedge can produce huge waves up to 30 feet (9.1 m) high.

##Ship Stern Bluff

Ship Stern Bluff is located in the Tasman National Park, Tasmania, between Cape Raoul and Tunnel Bay.
It is approximately a 30 km boat/jet ski ride from the coast to the Bluff and is regarded amongst the surfing community as one of the wildest and most dangerous locations in the world, both for the surf and the prevalence of great white sharks. The wave is also well known for its multi-faceted inner formations, referred to by many of its surfers as steps, which give the wave a unique appearance and greatly adds to the challenge of surfing it.

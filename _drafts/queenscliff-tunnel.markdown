Some time around 1908 a group of local fishermen decided that there had to be an easier way to get to the good fishing grounds that lay between Queeenscliff and Freshwater. Their solution was to chisel a tunnel through the headland.
Mr. Lewers and his mate Mr. Randell got together with other members of the Fishermens' Club and hammered their way through. It is still in use much to the delight of the small children and rock hopping fishermen of today.

Over the years the nor'east winds and southerly storms have blown through it eating away at the walls, making it bigger but no less sound.
